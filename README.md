<h1>Update Threats Definitions and Run Antivirus Scans</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

For this project I completed an internal security audit for an immaginary company based in the U.S.</b>

This activity belongs to _Identify_, the first of the five key functions composing the [**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)</b>

A security audit is a review of the organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.</b>

This project comprises of three documents:</b>

1. [_Controls assessment_](https://github.com/arnius88/InternalAudit/blob/main/1.Controls%20assessment.pdf), where I listed the current assets. Here, I was able to assess and prioritize them based on the need to implement various administrative, technical and physical controls across the company.
2. [_Compliance checklist_](https://github.com/arnius88/InternalAudit/blob/main/2.Compliance%20checklist.pdf), where I determined what compliance regulations and policies the company needs to adhere to do business online and outside of the U.S.
3. [_Stakeholder memorandum_](https://github.com/arnius88/InternalAudit/blob/main/3.Stakeholder%20memorandum.pdf), is a final document where I included scope and goals of the audit as well as findings and final recommendations to be reported to stakeholders in order to seek approval and increase security spending.
