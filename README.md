<h2>Project walk-through</h2>

<h3><p align="center">1.Update threat definitions: </h3>

I updated the threat definitions (also known as security intelligence) by manually checking for updates within the _Virus and Threat Protection updates_ area of Windows Defender.</b>

<h3><p align="center">2.Run Antivirus Quick Scan: </h3>

I ran a quick scan by pressing the relevant button withing the _Current threats_ area of Microsoft Defender.</b>

By clicking _Threat History_, once the scan is completed, I accessed the details of any recent findings. In this section, I can view whether any threats was identified. In addition, I can see any quarantined file as well as any object that was recognized as a threat but is still allowed to run in the machine (_Allowed threats_).</b>

<h3><p align="center">3.Run a custom scan: </h3>

I decided to run a custom scan that only scans files included in the **Downloads** folder. To achieve this is followed the following path:</b>



Select **Scan options** under the **Quick scan** button > Select **Custom scan**, then click **Scan now** > Select the **Downloads** folder and click the **Select Folder** button > Click  **Scan now**.</b>
